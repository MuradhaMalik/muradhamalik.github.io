# Hello World!
This is the official PocketStream website! It is a work in progress (for the time being). If you would like to know more about myself (Murad Malik), head on over to my personal [website!](https://muradhamalik.github.io/Murad-s-Page/)

# Technologies
PocketStream utilises two technologies: remote desktop and virtual desktop software. We (hypotheticaly) would have a server with hundreds of virtual machines. Next, those virtual machines would be configured so that a user (with the right credentials) can log in to the aforementioned virtual desktop. Finally, the end user would use a portal to log into their virtual machine.
